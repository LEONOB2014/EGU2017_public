# Data

This folder contains a random 10 % (fish wise) subset of the entire test set, mainly because of size restrictions for a GitHub repository. If you want to test the networks on the entire dataset you can download the .zip archive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3YsW-PFiJOLdkRxS05DdGRraTA) (306 MB).

If you download the entire set, make sure you extract the content directly into the `data/` folder, so that the structure stays identical (one folder for each species within the `data/` folder).

The `.csv` files are needed for the test set evaluation and should not be changed nor renamed. They contain the additional features, such as length and the one-hot encoded date vector that belongs to each of the images.
